# Network Optimization

**Project Overview**
The project involves optimizing the flow of containers in a liner shipping network, focusing on containerized transportation. Large vessels, capable of carrying over 18,000 containers, operate on scheduled routes similar to buses, with additional vessels deployed to ensure weekly departures when round trips exceed seven days.

The task includes managing transshipment, where containers may need to be unloaded and reloaded at intermediate ports. The given scenario, MEDITLINE, represents a small liner shipping network with nodes as ports and edges as legs sailed by vessels, each with specific costs and capacities. The objective is to optimize the flow of containers of varying sizes, measured in TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units), through this network, ensuring efficient use of vessel capacity and minimizing costs.
